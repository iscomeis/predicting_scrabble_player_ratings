# 🧠 Predicting Scrabble Player Ratings

In **Scrabble Player Ratings** project, we'll unlock insights from gameplay data to predict player ratings using cutting-edge **deep learning regression** techniques. 🖥️✨

### 🗺️ What We'll Do:
1. **Explore the Data** 📊: Dive into the dataset and understand the patterns hidden within Scrabble games.
2. **Visualize Insights** 🌈: Create visualizations to make sense of the relationships and trends.
3. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️: Transform raw data into meaningful features to feed our deep learning model.
4. **Build the Model** 🤖: Design a powerful and complex deep learning architecture to predict player ratings with precision.
5. **Evaluate and Visualize Results** 🔍: Assess our model's performance and showcase results with informative plots.

### 📖 Dataset Source
This project utilizes data from [Kaggle's Scrabble Player Rating Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/scrabble-player-rating/overview), providing  gameplay information to train and evaluate our model.
